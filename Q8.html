<!-- 8.	What is ajax ? -->


    <h1>Ajax is a script on the client side communicating asynchronously with the server without a complete page refresh. <br>
    	The best description I came across about Ajax as “the method of exchanging data with a server, <br>
    	 and updating parts of a web page – without reloading the entire page.”</h1>
